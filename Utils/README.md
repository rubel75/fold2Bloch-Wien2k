Utilities that help to generate a list of k points and plot the unfolded band structure

### ubs_dots.m

MATLAB code to plot the unfolded band structure as a bubble plot. This is the fastest way to visualize bands.

### ubs_bmp.m

Octave script to prepare a binary file “case.f2b.bin” for the “heat map” plotting style (similar to ARPES).

### f2b-band-structure.plt

Gnuplot script that takes the binary file “case.f2b.bin” generated by “ubs_bmp.m” and produces a publication-quality raster plot.

### ubs_dots_w2k_octave.m

Octave code to plot the unfolded band structure as a bubble plot. This is the fastest way to visualize bands. (Unmaintained)
